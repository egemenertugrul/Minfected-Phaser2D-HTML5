# Minfected
A phaser game I made for the game programming class

It is nothing fancy, however, some of the mechanics in the game were developed by me, such as the lightning (which is basically masking), zombie AI and bullet hits.

You can play it here: http://minfected.azurewebsites.net/minfected/

Used Tiled to draw the map. Found survivor (https://opengameart.org/content/animated-top-down-survivor-player) and zombie (https://opengameart.org/content/animated-top-down-zombie) sprites on opengameart. (the tileset is also found from opengameart but couldn't find the source now).
